The argument could be made that solutions to hackerrank challenges
shouldn't be published publicly.  If you look at the discussion tab
of any hackerrank challenge, however, somebody has posted a solution
for anybody to copy/paste and pretend they solved the challenge.
As solutions are so readily available, I'm not concerned about posting
mine here to keep.

Besides, nobody's going to read my repositories!
